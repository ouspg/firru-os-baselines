#!/bin/bash
# loot-host.sh — Collect listening socket data from host and all network namespaces.
#
# Requires root (nsenter needs CAP_SYS_ADMIN).
#
# This is the acquisition end of firru's input contract: it writes the files
# firru.discovery reads back, and it is the only place they come from. Copy it
# to the host, run it as root, bring the directory back as
# hosts/<hostname>/loot-host/, and point `firru synth` or `loot-listeners` at
# the tree. Any transport will do -- ansible fetch, scp, or
#
#     ssh root@host 'bash -s' < loot-host.sh
#
# Transport is deliberately not this script's job yet. The shape it wants is a
# driver that streams the output back in one hop (`... | tar xf -`) and checks
# what came out, because the failures worth catching are the quiet ones: a host
# where nft was absent, a netns sweep that found nothing because nsenter was
# blocked, a truncated fetch that leaves a plausible-looking half tree. A shell
# pipe reports none of those. Until that driver exists, read the manifest and
# the per-host file list by hand.
#
# Output files (per netns, including host):
#   ss              — ss -tulnpe  (includes socket inodes via -e)
#   psexe           — pid, user, comm, args
#   ipaddr          — ip addr show
#   ipaddr.json     — ip -j addr show, when iproute2 supports -j. The text form
#                     is for reading; this one is for parsing, and it is what
#                     carries the interface prefix length. A mask recovered by
#                     regex from the text form is a mask that silently goes
#                     missing the first time the output format shifts.
#   iproute         — ip route show  (reachability context for 0.0.0.0 listeners)
#   nft.json        — nft -j list ruleset  (the running firewall, with counters)
#   iptables        — iptables-save / ip6tables-save, where nft is not in use
#   conntrack       — conntrack -L -o ktimestamp, where conntrack-tools is
#                     installed (host netns only; `loot-conntrack FILE` reads it)
#
# Per extra netns additionally:
#   netnsN-ipaddr.json — ip -j addr show inside the netns
#   netnsN-meta     — pid, ns inode, lsns label (if lsns available)
#   netnsN-cgroup   — /proc/$pid/cgroup  (container/pod attribution)
#
# Top-level:
#   manifest.sha256 — sha256 of sorted ss output per netns (drift detection)
#
# Usage:
#   sudo ./loot-host.sh [outdir]
#   outdir defaults to /tmp/loot-$(hostname -f)
